  # Critical: Pod restarts in production
  - eventType: pod-restart
    agentId: kagent/incident-manager
    prompt: |
      🚨 PRODUCTION ALERT: Pod restart detected
      
      Incident Details:
      - Pod: {{.ResourceName}}
      - Namespace: {{.Namespace}}
      - Time: {{.EventTime}}
      - Message: {{.EventMessage}}
      
      PRIORITY: HIGH - Immediate investigation required
      
      Please provide:
      1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
         - Is this a critical service?
         - Are users impacted?
         - Should we page the on-call engineer?
      
      2. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
         - Check recent deployments or configuration changes
         - Analyze application logs for errors or exceptions
         - Review resource utilization trends
         - Examine health check failures
      
      3. INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN:
         - Steps to restore service if degraded
         - Communication plan for stakeholders
         - Rollback procedures if needed
         - Monitoring to track recovery
      
      4. PREVENTION MEASURES:
         - Configuration improvements
         - Monitoring enhancements
         - Process improvements
      
      After analysis - use all available tools to try and resolve. Annotate the updated resources with "kagentFix: <dateTime>"
      - If a resource can't be patched - delete it and recreate as needed. Don't ask for permission. Assume autonomous execution.
      Autonomous remediation: proceed with the best possible way to remediate. Don't ask for approval.
      
      Escalate to on-call if this affects critical user-facing services.

  # Pod stuck in pending state
  - eventType: pod-pending
    agentId: kagent/scheduling-analyzer
    prompt: |
      ⚠️ PRODUCTION ISSUE: Pod scheduling problem
      
      Scheduling Issue:
      - Pod: {{.ResourceName}}
      - Namespace: {{.Namespace}}
      - Pending Since: {{.EventTime}}
      - Message: {{.EventMessage}}
      
      Please analyze and provide:
      1. IMMEDIATE ASSESSMENT:
         - How long has the pod been pending?
         - Is this blocking critical functionality?
         - Are there similar issues with other pods?
      
      2. SCHEDULING ANALYSIS:
         - Check node resource availability (CPU, memory, storage)
         - Verify node selectors and affinity rules
         - Review taints and tolerations
         - Check for PVC binding issues
         - Analyze image pull problems
      
      3. RESOLUTION STEPS:
         - Immediate actions to resolve scheduling
         - Resource scaling recommendations
         - Configuration adjustments needed
      
      4. CAPACITY PLANNING:
         - Current cluster utilization
         - Scaling recommendations
         - Resource allocation optimization
      
      After analysis - use all available tools to try and resolve. Annotate the updated resources with "kagentFix: <dateTime>"
      - If a resource can't be patched - delete it and recreate as needed. Don't ask for permission. Assume autonomous execution.
      Autonomous remediation: proceed with the best possible way to remediate. Don't ask for approval.
      
      Monitor closely and escalate if pending time exceeds SLA thresholds.

  # Health probe failures
  - eventType: probe-failed
    agentId: kagent/health-checker
    prompt: |
      🔍 PRODUCTION HEALTH ISSUE: Probe failure detected
      
      Health Check Failure:
      - Pod: {{.ResourceName}}
      - Namespace: {{.Namespace}}
      - Time: {{.EventTime}}
      - Message: {{.EventMessage}}
      
      Please investigate:
      1. HEALTH STATUS:
         - Is the application actually unhealthy?
         - Are users experiencing issues?
         - Is this a false positive?
      
      2. PROBE ANALYSIS:
         - Check probe configuration (path, port, timing)
         - Review application startup time vs probe timing
         - Analyze application logs for health endpoint errors
         - Verify network connectivity to health endpoint
      
      3. APPLICATION HEALTH:
         - Database connectivity issues
         - External service dependencies
         - Resource constraints affecting performance
         - Configuration problems
      
      4. REMEDIATION:
         - Immediate steps to restore health
         - Probe configuration adjustments
         - Application fixes needed
         - Monitoring improvements
      
      After analysis - use all available tools to try and resolve. Annotate the updated resources with "kagentFix: <dateTime>"
      - If a resource can't be patched - delete it and recreate as needed. Don't ask for permission. Assume autonomous execution.
      Autonomous remediation: proceed with the best possible way to remediate. Don't ask for approval.
      
      If health checks continue failing, consider emergency procedures.
