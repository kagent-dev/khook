  # Monitor pod pending issues in CI/CD environments
  - eventType: pod-pending
    agentRef:
      name: ci-cd-engineer
    prompt: |
      AUTONOMOUS MODE: CI/CD ALERT - Pod {{.ResourceName}} pending since {{.EventTime}}. Pipeline blocked.

      INSTRUCTIONS:
      ‚Ä¢ Use all available tools to diagnose deployment and resource issues
      ‚Ä¢ Check CI/CD cluster capacity, build agents, and pipeline status
      ‚Ä¢ Implement immediate fixes and optimization strategies
      ‚Ä¢ Annotate fixed resources with: kagentFix=<timestamp>
      ‚Ä¢ If patching fails: delete and recreate resources
      ‚Ä¢ Never ask for permission - assume autonomous execution
      ‚Ä¢ Complete remediation without human approval

  # Monitor restarts in CI/CD environments
  - eventType: pod-restart
    agentRef:
      name: ci-cd-engineer
      namespace: kagent
    prompt: |
      üîß CI/CD ALERT: Build/test pod restarted
      
      Pipeline Restart:
      - Pod: {{.ResourceName}}
      - Namespace: {{.Namespace}}
      - Time: {{.EventTime}}
      - Message: {{.EventMessage}}
      
      CI/CD IMPACT ANALYSIS:
      
      1. PIPELINE IMPACT:
         - Which build or test job was affected?
         - Is the pipeline failure blocking releases?
         - Are there cascading effects on other pipelines?
         - Data loss risk for build artifacts or test results
      
      2. BUILD ENVIRONMENT ISSUES:
         - Build agent stability and configuration
         - Resource limits for build/test workloads
         - Dependency management and caching issues
         - Test environment consistency problems
      
      3. AUTOMATION RELIABILITY:
         - Pipeline retry logic effectiveness
         - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
         - Build reproducibility and consistency
         - Test flakiness and reliability issues
      
      4. OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:
         - Build time optimization strategies
         - Resource utilization improvements
         - Parallel execution enhancements
         - Caching and artifact management
      
      5. RECOVERY ACTIONS:
         - Immediate steps to restore pipeline
         - Build/test re-execution procedures
         - Artifact recovery if needed
         - Timeline impact assessment
      
      After analysis - use all available tools to try and resolve. Annotate the updated resources with "kagentFix: <dateTime>"
      - If a resource can't be patched - delete it and recreate as needed. Don't ask for permission. Assume autonomous execution.
      Autonomous remediation: proceed with the best possible way to remediate. Don't ask for approval.
      
      Ensure minimal disruption to development workflow.

  # Monitor probe failures in CI/CD services
  - eventType: probe-failed
    agentId: kagent/ci-cd-engineer
    prompt: |
      ‚ö†Ô∏è CI/CD SERVICE: Health check failure
      
      Service Health Issue:
      - Service: {{.ResourceName}}
      - Namespace: {{.Namespace}}
      - Time: {{.EventTime}}
      - Message: {{.EventMessage}}
      
      CI/CD SERVICE ANALYSIS:
      
      1. SERVICE AVAILABILITY:
         - Which CI/CD service is affected?
         - Impact on active builds and deployments
         - User access and functionality impact
         - Integration with external tools and services
      
      2. DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS:
         - Database or storage connectivity issues
         - External service integration problems
         - Authentication and authorization service health
         - Network connectivity and DNS resolution
      
      3. PERFORMANCE ISSUES:
         - Service response time degradation
         - Resource utilization and bottlenecks
         - Queue processing and job execution delays
         - Concurrent user load impact
      
      4. CONFIGURATION VALIDATION:
         - Service configuration correctness
         - Environment variable and secret validation
         - Network policies and security settings
         - Load balancer and ingress configuration
      
      5. RECOVERY STRATEGY:
         - Immediate service restoration steps
         - Failover to backup systems if available
         - User communication and status updates
         - Post-incident review and improvements
      
      After analysis - use all available tools to try and resolve. Annotate the updated resources with "kagentFix: <dateTime>"
      - If a resource can't be patched - delete it and recreate as needed. Don't ask for permission. Assume autonomous execution.
      Autonomous remediation: proceed with the best possible way to remediate. Don't ask for approval.
      
      Prioritize restoring CI/CD service availability quickly.
